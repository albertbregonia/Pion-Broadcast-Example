# Peer to Peer Call Example

A map is used to save websocket connections and usernames of connected users.
To use this example:
- Start the server with the makefile by running `make`
- Connect to `https://localhost/` in the browser
- Have two people create unique usernames and hit `Register`
- Have one person call the other by entering the peer's username into the second dialog box and then hit `Call`
