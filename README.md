# Pion Broadcast Example
This repository serves as an example/template for creating a WebRTC based Web Application.

This is the format I usually follow and I will use this repository as a boilerplate to constantly `git clone`
when testing new ideas for projects that use WebRTC. A lot of this setup is usually very tedious and that is why
I have organized everything into a manner that will be easily debuggable and allow me to get to production faster.

## Dependencies
- [Pion WebRTC](https://github.com/pion/webrtc)
- [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)
